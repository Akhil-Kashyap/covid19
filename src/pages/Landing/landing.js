					<h2>How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>

					<p className="lg-p info">
						COVID-19 spreads by an infected person coughing and/or sneezing, thus producing infected respiratory droplets.
						This is person-to-person spread, most often by inhalation.
					</p>

					<p className="lg-p info">
						It also spreads by touching surfaces where infected droplets land followed by touching your eyes, nose, and/or
						face and mouth. There is no airborne spread like the measles virus.
					</p>
					<p className="lg-p info">
						Unfortunately, some people can be infected and have little or no symptoms yet still be able to spread COVID-19 to
						others.
